/**
 * Project: What's for Dinner?
 * 
 * 
 * Now that you've learned how to draw and color shapes, use your skills to make something fun: dinner!
 * 
 * The program below only includes a simple plate, it's up to you to put dinner on the plate.
 * Use shapes like rect(), ellipse(), and triangle() to draw food on the plate.
 * Use fill() and stroke() to color them.
 * 
 * After you're done, show it to your friends and family.
 * Offer to cook it for them for dinner tomorrow. :-)
