/**
 * Challenge: My Favorite Foods
 * 
 * 
 * Step 1: First, a heading!
 * We're making a list of your favorite foods, but first we need a header.
 * Write 'My Favorite Foods' near the top of the canvas.
 * 
 * Oh Noes will try to help you fixing problems with the code, but sometimes he doesn't know what you're trying to do and how to fix it.
 * If there is a problem with a text command, make sure that command has:
  - Quotation marks around the entire message, like so: "My Favorite Foods";
  - Commas in the right places, between every argument - check the hint code;
  - Exactly 3 arguments: the message, the x position and the y position.
 * 
 * 
 * Step 2: BIGGER text!
 * That text is small, aye? Let's make it easier to read by making the text bigger.
 * You can change the size of your text by using the textSize command before the text command.
 * 
 * 
 * Step 3: Now, the foods!
 * Now, use the text() command three times, to make a list of your favorite foods. Each should be on a separate line.
 * 
 * If Oh Noes points out a problem with a text command, make sure that command has:
  - Quotation marks around the entire message, like so: "1. Brocolli" ;
  - Commas in the right places, between every argument - check the hint code;
  - Exactly 3 arguments: the message, the x position and the y position.
