/**
 * Challenge: Simple snowman
 * 
 * 
 * Step 1: The bottom
 * Draw a snowman using the ellipse() command.
 * 
 * Start off by making a circle, for the bottom of the snowman, with an ellipse() command.
 * This should be the first ellipse() command in your program.
 * 
 * 
 * Step 2: The middle
 * Now draw a second circle, for the middle of your snowman, using another ellipse() command.
 * This should be the second ellipse() command in your program.
 * 
 * Make sure that your second circle is a little smaller than the bottom circle, and that it sits on top of the bottom circle.
 * 
 * 
 * Step 3: The head
 * Now draw a third circle, for the head of your snowman, using another ellipse() command.
 * This should be the third ellipse() command in your program.
 * 
 * Make sure that your third circle is a little smaller than the middle circle, and that it sits on top of the middle circle, because that's what heads do.
