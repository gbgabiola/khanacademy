# Project: Recipe book

Create a web page with your favorite recipes! The recipe book should have a table of contents linking to each recipe below, using internal links. Each recipe should have a table for the ingredients, a list of details, and a list and/or paragraphs of the steps required. If you use recipes from the internet, be sure to add a link to the website.

Use CSS to style the recipe book, using a mix of the simple selectors and colors that you've learned.

**Tip**: Can't find the images you want in our image selector? You can also bring in images from Wikipedia. To do that, use a [site-restricted Google search](http://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1439&bih=778&q=site%3Awikipedia.org+&oq=site%3Awikipedia.org+&gs_l=img.3...437.4670.0.4871.33.7.2.24.0.0.135.615.6j1.7.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..27.6.459.QLGFMUmn4qs#tbm=isch&q=site:wikipedia.org+pineapple), then click "View image" on the result you like, and copy the URL into your `<img>` tag.
