<!-- Project: Travel webpage

In this project, you'll use everything you've learned so far to create a travel website enticing viewers to visit an exotic locale.
You should have images of what they'll see, lists of things to see and places to go, and paragraphs of enticing details.
You should also use CSS to style the website, using a mix of the simple selectors you've learned. -->

  <h2>Sout Africa</h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/CapeTPano123.jpg/1920px-CapeTPano123.jpg">
  <p> South Africa is a large country of massively varied and spectacular terrain - from the picturesque Cape Winelands to the awesome Drakensberg Mountains and the unspoilt wilderness of the bush. </p>
  <p>There's loads to do - nature lovers and adventure seekers will not be disappointed. Its wealth of plantlife is outstanding and there are few better places to see Africa's wildlife. For those just wanting to relax, there's mile upon mile of glorious sandy beaches - some of the best and least crowded in the world. </p>
  
  
  <h2>Scotland</h2>

  <p>No-one goes to Scotland for the weather. But once you've stop bemoaning it, the drizzle has a charm of its own; and how well it suits the land of glassy loch and heathery glen beloved of Walter Scott and John Buchan. Though the huntin', fishin' and shootin' may be gracefully retiring to make way for the pastimes of a more modern age - sea kayaking, whale-watching, mountain biking - Scotland's golfing scene flourishes, its 556 courses ever green.</p>
  
  <h2>Sri Lanka</h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/World%27s_End_precipice.jpg">
  <p>This beautiful tropical island has something for everyone - palm-fringed golden beaches, cool hill stations, tea plantations, lush rainforest, wildlife, ancient cities, Buddhist temples and colourful festivals. There are some beautiful places to stay, the cooking is good and spicy, the cost of living is relatively low, and the Sri Lankan people are friendly and generous. Its compact size allows you to appreciate the diversified attractions in just a couple of weeks. And although it's an established tourist destination (mainly British and German visitors), Sri Lanka remains largely unspoilt. </p>
  
  <h2>Balearic Islands</h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Mallorca_Schweinebucht_-_panoramio.jpg">
  <p>You’ll probably have preconceptions about Ibiza: jam-packed clubs, rowdy crowds, a hedonistic lifestyle. But there’s a whole other side to this Balearic island, too: a tranquil, laid-back, beautiful one. Just 10 minutes' drive from the carousing of San Antoni or Eivissa, Ibiza unfolds into glorious cove beaches and a simple, rural landscape. Empty winding roads, aromatic pine forests, meticulously ploughed fields and row upon row of orange, almond and olive trees sit alongside craggy rocks and dry stone walls. Goats wander untethered down rough tracks. </p>
  
  <h2>Porto, Portugal</h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Porto_and_Douro_pano_from_top_of_Gaia.jpg">
  <p>Portugal’s second city is one of Europe’s oldest. It’s been inhabited since Roman times and Ribeira, its UNESCO-listed centre, is a delightfully shabby jumble of skinny townhouses, sun-dappled squares and laundry-strung alleys which spill down to the barge-lined quaysides of the Douro river. But it also has a distinctly modern edge, with burgeoning culinary and cultural scenes, a sparkling new metro system, and an ever-increasing array of stylish hotels, apartments and B&Bs. </p>
  
  <h2>Mexico</h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Palacio_de_cortez_9.jpg">
  <p>The 2 mountain chains of the Sierra Madre converge in Oaxaca state, and then run down in a single line to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, creating great mountaineering and hiking terrain. In the south, hilltop pine forests slowly give way to lush tropical forest and then jungle on the coast, with steamy inland lagoons with resident alligators. </p>
  
  <h2>Normandy, France</h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Petit-andely-depuis-chateau-gaillard.jpg">
  <p>Normandy is the land of the apple. In spring, when the apple trees blossom, it dons a petticoat of pink and white lace; in autumn, the intoxicating smell of fermenting apples permeates its lush countryside and half-timbered barns. The apples are transformed into cider, into cream-drenched tartes, or into the tipple of the gods, calvados. The drink even managed to give its name to one of the five départements into which Normandy is divided. </p>
  
  <h2>Morocco</h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Merzouga_sahara.jpg">
  <p>It's colourful, friendly and exotic with a fascinating mix of Arab, Islamic, Berber, African and European influences. Spectacular landscapes range from miles of unspoilt beaches to magnificent snow-capped mountains, from lush river valleys to vast tracts of desert, as well as labyrinthine walled medieval cities and Berber fortresses. A wealth of beautiful handicrafts that can be picked up for a song – and a ritual bout of haggling – in the heaving city souks. Traditional townhouses (known as riads) and kasbahs beautifully restored to create hidden guesthouses, varying from luxurious to comfortably basic. Delicious home-cooked tagines and couscous. The promise of year-round sunshine and warmth and all within 4 hours flying time from northern Europe.</p>
