<!-- Challenge: Links you love


Step 1: Add links
This webpage contains a list with three empty items.
Add a link in each item, pointing at one of your favorite websites (or maybe your three favorite subjects on Khan Academy!)


Step 2: Link love
Now, below the list, turn the heart image into a link by writing the opening <a> tag before the <img> tag and writing the closing </a> tag after it.
