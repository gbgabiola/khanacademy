<!-- The overflowing ocean


Step 1: Resize the div
This webpage describes the ocean, with an image and a few paragraphs which are inside a <div>.

Style the <div> that has a class of 'info', so that it takes up 70% of the width and is 200px tall.
  

Step 2: Make it scroll
Make it so the div cuts off the overflowing text and presents a scrollbar instead.


Step 3: Resize the img
Write a CSS rule for the ‘pic’ class that resizes the image to take up the same width as the text.-->
