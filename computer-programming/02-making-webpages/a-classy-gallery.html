<!-- Challenge: A classy gallery


Add multiple classes
This webpage has three images in the body, but there are no styles yet.

We've defined a few CSS rules with class selectors at the top.
Some of the rules change the size of the image, and others change the border.

Add two class names to each image so that the sizes and borders vary from each other. Mix and match, try a few out! -->
