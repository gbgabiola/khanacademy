<!-- Challenge: The boxer model

Step 1: Add borders
This webpage displays a gallery of photos of boxer dogs.
Add a border to all of the photos.
Try and make it look like a photo frame, if you can.


Step 2: Add margin
The photos look a bit too close to each other.
Add margin to them, either on all sides or just the sides that matter to separate them.

Step 3: Add padding
The photos are too close to the side of the gallery div, and it looks weird.
Add padding around all sides of the gallery div so that it looks better. -->
