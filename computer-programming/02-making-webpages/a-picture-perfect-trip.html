<!-- Challenge: A picture-perfect trip

Step 1: Add images
If you could take the perfect trip, where would you go?
What animals would you see?
What food would you eat?
Add images to this webpage after each paragraph tag, to share your perfect trip with the world.


Step 2: Resize them
We want you to experiment with the width and height attributes, so try adding them to your images. -->
