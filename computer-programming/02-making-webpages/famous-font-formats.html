<!-- Challenge: Famous font formats


Step 1: Make italic quotes
This webpage displays some famous quotes and declarations from movies and TV shows.
Add a CSS rule that makes all of the quotes have an italic font style, so they'll look more like quotes.


Step 2: Make bold declarations
Add a CSS rule that makes all of the declarations have a bold font weight, so they'll look like they were said in a loud voice. -->
