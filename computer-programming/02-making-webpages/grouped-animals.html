<!-- Challenge: Grouped animals


Group the selectors
This is a webpage about animal group names, with a few headings and images as examples.

There are already 2 CSS rules to style the <h1>s, one with a pseudo selector, and one without.

Add another selector to each of the rules, so that they also style <h2>s. -->
