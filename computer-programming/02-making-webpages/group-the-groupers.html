<!-- Challenge: Group the groupers


Step 1: Add spans
This webpage describes groupers, a type of large ocean fish.
Make the first sentences of each paragraph stand out.
Start by adding <span> tags around each first sentence.
Then give both of your <span> tags a class called "first-sentence".
  

Step 2: Style Spans
Write a CSS rule to style your "first-sentence" class.
Make the sentence either bold, or underlined.


Step 3: Add a div
Wrap the paragraphs in a single <div>, and then give the div a class of "info".


Step 4: Style the Div
Write a CSS rule to style your 'info' class.
Give it a cool looking background color. -->
