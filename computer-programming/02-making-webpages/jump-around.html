<!-- Challenge: Jump around


Step1: Add internal links
This is a long webpage describing kangaroos, and each section heading has an id attribute.
Find out what those id attributes are, and then change the href attributes of the links at the top to point at the appropriate section.


Step 2: Add one more
There's one more link at the bottom that should link back to the top. Fix its href so that it does that. -->
