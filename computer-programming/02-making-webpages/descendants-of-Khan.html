<!-- Challenge: Descendants of Khan


Step 1: Add descendant rules
This webpage describes Genghis Khan, an emperor who had many descendants, and includes a table with just a few of the emperors that descended from him.
Add a rule that targets only the elements that have the 'emperor' class and are in the table.
The rule should change the background color of those table cells.


Step 2: Add descendant rules
Now add another rule that targets only the elements that have the class name 'reign' and in the table.
Like in the first step, the rule should change the background color of those table cells.
Pick a different color than you picked for the other rule! -->
