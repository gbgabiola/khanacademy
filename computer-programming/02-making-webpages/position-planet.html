<!-- Challenge: Position planet


Step 1: Position the creature
This webpage contains an image of a planet, an image of a creature, and a div with a greeting.
Make it look like the creature is sitting on the planet and saying the greeting.
Use absolute positioning to put the creature on top of the planet somewhere.


Step 2: Position the greeting
Position the greeting on top of the planet as well.


Step 3: Order them
Use a z-index property to make sure that the greeting always shows up over the creature, not behind. -->
