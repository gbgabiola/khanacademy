<!-- Challenge: Floating clouds


Step 1: Float the photo
This webpage contains information on clouds plus a photo of clouds. Float the photo to the left of the text, so that the text wraps around it.


Step 2: Float the sidebar
There's a yellow div of information.
Make that div float to the right of the text, so that the photo is on the left side of the text and the yellow div is on the right side of the text.


Step 3: Add margins
Now that we have elements floated next to eachother, we should make sure to separate them with some whitespace.
Add appropriate margins to the photo and the sidebar. -->
