<!-- Challenge: Classes of elements


Step 1: Make more specific rules
This webpage describes one classification of elements in the periodic table: metals, non-metals, and semi-metals.
It uses CSS rules with class selectors to color those words, both in the top paragraph and the headings.

Style the headings so that their background is the same color as their text.
Then change the text color to white so that you can read it.
Start by styling the headings with the 'metal' class.


Step 2: Make more specific rules
Add a new rule for headings with the 'non-metal' class.


Step 3: Make more specific rules
Do the same thing for headings with the 'semi-metal' class.-->
