      <strong>Nobody’s born smart</strong>. We all start at 0. Can’t
      <em>talk</em>, can’t <em>walk</em>, certainly can’t do
      <em>algebra</em>.<br />
      Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike.
      <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at <em>first</em></strong
      >.<br />
      <strong
        >There was a time when Einstein <em>couldn’t</em> count to 10</strong
      >.<br />
      <strong>And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs</strong> just like the rest
      of us.<br />
      <strong><em>Thankfully</em>, we are born to learn</strong>.<br />
      Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br />
      <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling</em>.<br />
      <strong>Until one day, you walk</strong>.<br />
      One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br />
      Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit
      <strong>stronger</strong>.<br />
      <em>Failing</em> is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br />
      <strong>This. is. learning</strong>.<br />
      It’s not that you don’t get it.<br />
      <strong>You just don’t get it, <em>yet</em></strong
      >. Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br />
      are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br />
      Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      You only have to know <em>one</em> thing:<br />
      <strong><em>You can learn anything</em></strong
      >.
